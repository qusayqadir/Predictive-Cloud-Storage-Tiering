<h1>Predictive Cloud Storage Tiering</h1>

Project Overview:
this codebase is for a dynamic data management system that uses machine learning to optimize the placement of data in different storage tiers based on usage patterns. 
This project reduces storage costs while maintaining efficient data accessibility by automatically moving files between hot, warm, and cold storage tiers in a cloud environment.
